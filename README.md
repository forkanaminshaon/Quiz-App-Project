* **Clean UI:** A simple, modern, and responsive design that works on all screen sizes.
* **Restart Functionality:** Allows the user to retake the quiz from the beginning.

##  Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the app.
* **CSS3:** For styling the application, including layout and button states.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the quiz logic, including:
    * DOM Manipulation (displaying questions, creating answer buttons)
